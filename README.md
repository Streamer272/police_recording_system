# What even is this?
This is my homework, where user has to enter speed, and the program must return how much do they have to 
pay if they crossed the speed limit.

## How do I run this?
You can run this opening run.sh in backend and frontend directory (working only on linux), note that you
have to have nodejs and npm installed (if not, you can download them [here](doc:https://nodejs.org/en/))
